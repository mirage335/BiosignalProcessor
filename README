Host ("driver") software for the 24bit Data Acqusition (ArduinoDAQ) integrated 

__Usage__
First compile using build.sh, then launch the software using run.sh. Some machines may need /dev/ttyACM0 replaced with a different file name.

__Design__
Uses libsndfile to read data over USB , processes the data using filters, then outputs the data in a format compatible with the baudline visualization software.

A direct form 2 IIR biquad filter has been implemented as a preprocessor macro for basic lowpass, highpass, bandpass, and notch filtering.

__Safety__
Same safety issues noted in the README for Mirage335BiosignalAmplifier apply while using this software for it. Surge suppression and power supply isolation are important requirements.

No claim of liability is made by anyone. Your accident is your accident. Use common sense. If you don't understand the safety features and limitations, don't use this software or Mirage335BiosignalAmplifier.
